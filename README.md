# NODE FARM - Node.js, Express and MongoDB 

This repo contains starter files and the finished project files for all the projects contained in the project


### Q4: Can I see a final version of the projects?

**A:** Absolutely! The main project is [Natours](https://www.natours.dev/) (it even got its own domain ðŸ˜Ž). You can log in with `laura@example.com` and password `test1234`. There is also an API at `/api`, with [documentation available here](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/4237486/S1LwxnaE?version=latest) (incomplete). The small Node.js introduction project is [Node Farm](https://node-farm.herokuapp.com/).



### Q11: Do you accept pull requests?

**A:** No, for the simple reason that I want this repository to contain the _exact_ same code.
